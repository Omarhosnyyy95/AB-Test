# Project Description

This project is an application on the advanced statistics lesson in the Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree program. In this project I'm Working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website for a company that has developed a new web page in order to try to increase the number of users who "convert". In this notebook I will try to help the company decide whether to implement this new page, keep the old page or perhaps run the experiment longer to make a decision.

# Results

The 2 approaches taken in the project to answer the question are **A/B Testing** and **Logistic Regression**. And both solutions recommend that we should fail to reject the null hypothesis, in other words, there is no evidence that the new page increases the conversion of customers.
